# javellship
A modern rendition of the classic game Battleship in Java and Haskell

Welcome to our CMPS-112 project

The game Battleship first started as a pencil paper game which dates back to World War I. Various companies published the game in the 1930â€™s until finally being released as a plastic board game in 1967. The game Battleship no longer needs to be played face to face; it can be played online against other human players, or against a simple AI. Even though it has been done over and over again, we are here to produce another rendition of a well known game.

Instructions on how to run the Java and the Haskell implementation are in their respective folders.
