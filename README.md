# javellship
A modern rendition of the classic game Battleship in Java and Haskell

Welcome to our CMPS-112 project

The game Battleship first started as a pencil paper game which dates back to World War I. Various companies published the game in the 1930’s until finally being released as a plastic board game in 1967. The game Battleship no longer needs to be played face to face; it can be played online against other human players, or against a simple AI. Even though it has been done over and over again, we are here to produce another rendition of a well known game.

Instructions on how to run the Java and the Haskell implementation are in their respective folders.

Battleship - Java Version

        To run the java version you need to install Netbeans with JDK 8, which can be found here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.htm


Haskell  - Haskell version

        To run haskell version you need to install the Haskell Platform, which can be found here: https://www.haskell.org/platform/

you can also read the report to see the comparisons that we did for the two different languages.

Enjoy!!
