To run the Java rendition of our game, you first need to have Netbeans installed.
Here is a download link if you do not: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Then, once it has been installed, open Netbeans. Go to file, open and select the 
file containing the java program, (it must be unzipped). Make sure you are opening
the file called Battleship, not the entire folder containing both the Haskell and
Java.

Then on the toolbar of Netbeans, pull down the drop menu that says run, and select 
run project (battleship). A seperate window should pop up with a title screen. Click 
through the title screen to begin ship placement.

To place ships, simply move the curser and left click to place the ship (shows as a 
series of green squares) in the desired position. To rotate the ship simply right click.
The board on the left is your board, and where you should place your ships.

After placing all five of your ships, move your curser to the opponents board (the right
board) and click where you want to fire. For every shot you fire, the opponent will fire 
one on your board in return. Misses are shown with blue squares, hits with yellow squares 
and sunk ships with red squares. 

The game continues until one player has lost all of their ships. After completing the game, 
a popup will show with the result of the match, clicking it will take you back to the 
homescreen. You can continue playing by clicking again.
